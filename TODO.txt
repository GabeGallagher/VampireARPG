I refactored the inventory controller to now equip the weapon object to the player. This is causing a bug with the transform of the
weapon objects relative to the character holding them, as well as a few null reference exceptions. Fix these before moving on.

There are several warnings for nullable variables. Fix these classes and add #nullable enable to classes that 
don't already have it

Implement projectiles into the game. This can be done by adding the Berserker's basic throwing attack. Should 
not be done until all other refactors are complete.
