The below refactor currently broke the interaction with harvestables (like trees). Fix that problem before moving on from below
refactor

Refactor Inventory System to handle a weapon gamebject instead of a SO. This is a necessary change to store
variable weapon mods

Refactor Player Controller to handle AttackController and attacking points. This may have to come from the 
weapon end or the player character's hand for physical attacks, not sure which yet.

Refactor bother Player and Enemy characters to face their target when attacking. They shouldn't move in
between attacks, so there needs to be some checking on the PlayerController if the player will attack again

There are several warnings for nullable variables. Fix these classes and add #nullable enable to classes that 
don't already have it

Implement projectiles into the game. This can be done by adding the Berserker's basic throwing attack. Should 
not be done until all other refactors are complete.
