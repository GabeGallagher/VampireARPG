Refactor AttackController.OnTriggerEnter to properly collide with the object being attacked, not the attacker

AttackController also needs to be refactored away from using a player/enemy paradigm and rather use attacker 
and target, with players, enemies, and projectiles all able to fill both roles

Refactor Player Controller to handle AttackController and attacking points. This may have to come from the 
weapon end or the player character's hand for physical attacks, not sure which yet.

Refactor bother Player and Enemy characters to face their target when attacking. They shouldn't move in
between attacks, so there needs to be some checking on the PlayerController if the player will attack again

There are several warnings for nullable variables. Fix these classes and add #nullable enable to classes that 
don't already have it

Implement projectiles into the game. This can be done by adding the Berserker's basic throwing attack. Should 
not be done until all other refactors are complete.
